        <h2>About us: Our Story and Mission</h4>
        <p>We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies, including using Bitcoin for payments, mining, and trading with different strategies. We also considered starting a company and extensively researched Ethereum and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a viable business model. Concerns about government intervention and the potential ban of Bitcoin always lingered. As a result, we pursued other entrepreneurial ventures and found some validation when the ICO wave ended with a crash. The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise. The influx of capital from established institutions, including the financial industry, made it increasingly challenging for the government to ban Bitcoin. However, we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so. Recently, when we attempted to transfer our old, now more valuable Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered that we had lost access to them completely. We were unable to locate our wallets in the first place.</p>

            <p>By a stupid mistake, I wrote down only 11 of 12 words of my seed phrase. Desperately I tried it myself but gave up after a short time. By chance, I came across ReWallet and asked if it would be possible to restore access to my wallet. Shorthand later we arranged a meeting in Berlin for the delivery of the seed phrase. About 4 weeks later I got the email that they have restored the access. Guys, you are great, we need people like you.</p>

            <p>I had pretty much written off my lost wallet until I came across ReWallet in forums. The good reviews prompted me to make an inquiry on the ReWallet site. At first, I was skeptical. But that was quickly dispelled. Promptly came a response, and it was probed whether a recovery of my wallet possible. After about 1 week came the positive news. Then everything went quickly and I was back in possession of my Wallet. </p>
